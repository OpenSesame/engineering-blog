## Overview

### React

Possibly the most well established of the current frameworks, React is the current most popular frontend library around. With several frameworks built on top of it (Next.js, Gatsby.js, Redwood.js, and more) it is the obvious choice for new developers. This is because of the levels of support available and the number of tools built around the ecosystem. It is not necessarily the easiest to learn, but 

### Angular

### Svelte

One of the newest players in the frontend landscape, [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) has taken the frontend by storm. Unlike Angular and React, Svelte offloads as much work as possible from the browser into a compile step during the build process. It also avoids the use of a virtual DOM in favor of surgical DOM updates when state changes. 

Like React, Svelte isn't "batteries included" out of the box, but, they do have [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) which is built as a framework around Svelte. It includes server-side rendering, hot module reloading, filesystem routing, and more and is intended as the defacto Svelte solution.

## TLDR

There is no "right" choice when it comes to choosing your frontend framework. All of the tools we have compared here have their pros and cons. At the end of the day,the best tool is the one that helps you and your team build amazing things. So evaluate the expertise your team has, your long term goals, and the market to make a choice for your next project. Then learn from that project to make the choice for the next one. The front end landscape changes quickly, so don't let analysis paralysis stop you from starting!
